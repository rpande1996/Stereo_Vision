## Overview

In this project, we are going to implement the concept of Stereo Vision. We will be given 3 different
datasets, each of them contains 2 images of the same scenario but taken from two different camera
angles. By comparing the information about a scene from 2 vantage points, we can obtain the
3D information by examining the relative positions of objects.
